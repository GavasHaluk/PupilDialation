# Vehware-Pupil Dilation Project First Version

This is the initial prototype of the ROME-blink-detection

Project requires Python 3.7, opencv, math libraries and numpy.

Summary Of The Project: Project aims to detect pupil dilation and pupil changes which happens as a reflex to the light.

Project measures pupil region and reflects it as a graph. The video must be recorded as in the example video eye-demo.mp4.
Eyelocal file can be used to determine threshold value by the programmer after images folder is created by dilate.py.
